## Framework : T cell early mechanoactivation

Cell/cell interactions are a paradigm in cell biology since they establish, through biochemical and mechanical contacts, the structures of the living, allowing the cellâ€™s function to take place and potentially synchronise their action. While the biochemical side has been intensively studied, the mechanics , and its articulation with biochemistry, together termed as mechanotransduction, is a current topic of enormous interest. , Its importance is more and more recognized to be instrumental to finely regulate cellular functions. The interface formed between a T cell and an antigen presenting cell during immune response, often called the immune synapse, is a prototypical interaction where mechanotransduction is a key regulating mechanism. 

This particular moment is crucial for adaptive immunity as this is when the pathological antigen is recognized by the T cell and the decision is taken whether to mount a response or not. The formation of the immune synapse ultimately leads to the production of inflammatory signals and mutual exchange of signals between the cells, as a prelude to the elimination of the pathogenic condition.

### The proposals

The following internships topics (Master 1/2 ; Ingenieer) that can be, if the funding is or become avaible turned into a full PhD project, propose to tackle some biophysical aspects of the T cell early mechanoactivation.
