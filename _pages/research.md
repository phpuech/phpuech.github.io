Our work is based on the study of mechanics and mechanotransduction of cells, mainly immune cells, in native or pathological situations. It can be divided in two main classes : 

For T lymphocytes, we try to have a better, more integrated picture, of their early activation :
  - Early T cell mechanotransduction with P. Pierobon, Cochin, J. Husson, LaDHyX, D. Gonzalez, Metz Univ.
  - T cell mechanostransduction & cholesterol with Y. Hamon, CIML, Marseille
  - Lymphocyte early biophysical activation with K. Sengupta, CINaM, L. Limozin, LAI

For phagocytes, we try to understand how their target biophysical characteristics impact their action :
  - Toxoplasma & Eimeria mechanics and adhesion, with A. Dumetre, Pharmacy Univ., Marseille — [http://toxophysics.wordpress.com/](http://toxophysics.wordpress.com/)

Aside, we participate in understanding how to tune the reaction of immune cells to pathological situations, in particular cancer :
  - Antibody recognition, with L. Limozin, Inserm U1067, Marseille

We organize collective efforts at the interface between physics and immunology : 
  - CNRS IRP FR/MEX BioPhysImmuno on "Adhesion and mechanics in fibrosis, lymphocyte/cancer or lymphocyte/APC interactions", with M. Hautefeuille, Sorbonne Univ. & T.Fioderlisio-Colle, UNAM, Mexico City, L. Limozin, LAI, K. Sengupta, CINAM  — [https://biophysimmuno.wordpress.com/](https://biophysimmuno.wordpress.com/)
