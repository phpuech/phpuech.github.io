We’re thrilled to announce that LAI’s 30th Anniversary Symposium took place on October 3rd and 4th at the Hexagon Auditorium in Luminy!

This special event featured a lineup of speakers sharing their research and insights covering the various topics of the lab. It was a unique opportunity to celebrate 30 years of research and reflect on our collective achievements. We are excited to welcome alumni, collaborators, associates of the lab, and the scientific community, who have all played a part in our journey.
